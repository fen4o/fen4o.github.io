Thanks to the great [Jekyll-Pithy](https://github.com/smallmuou/Jekyll-Pithy),
we now have a simple blog.

One of the first thing we are going to look at is the [Sofia Traffic
website](http://www.sofiatraffic.bg/) and why it doesn't likes to have it's data
visible in Google Maps. Some of the ranting will be in Bulgarian or in
English... I don't know yet.

Oh and I may add [Diqus](https://disqus.com/), so I can talk with myself.

Let's see how things wrap up. Tomorrow or some other day.
